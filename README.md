# Webpack PRPL boilerplate
A boilerplate that allows to easily build multi-target web apps (ES5, ES6) ready to be served by
[PRPL Server](https://github.com/Polymer/prpl-server).

## What you get out of the box
#### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
Apart from the Service Worker, the entire project has been written in 
TypeScript, so that you can write modern and robust code without the hassle 
of configuring everything from scratch. The brand new 
[Babel TypeScript preset](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2018/08/27/typescript-and-babel-7) 
has been used to make the development workflow much easier. The 
`BROWSERSLIST` environment variable is used to tell Babel whether to 
transpile the code to ES6 (i.e. `edge > 12`, since Edge 13 was the first 
Microsoft browser that fully supported ES6) or to ES5 (i.e. `ie > 9`, since 
Internet Explorer 10 was the first Microsoft browser that fully supported 
ES5).

_Note: the Service Worker will be written in TypeScript too as soon as it 
becomes possible to do that without using awful workarounds.

more info._

#### [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
CSS is great, but it misses some essential features. Sass will help you get 
covered with them, so that you can seamlessly write easy-to-read CSS code. 
You also won't need to worry about vendor prefixes, as 
[PostCSS autoprefixer plugin](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) will 
take care of them, using the same `BROWSERSLIST` used by Babel to check what 
of them are needed for your target build.

#### [EJS](http://ejs.co)
Many times you might need to change something on your HTML files based on 
your current build or whatever else. EJS is a simple JavaScript templating 
system that allows you to write JavaScript code that will be compiled by 
Webpack **at build time**. For example, if you need to load some polyfills 
for the ES5 build without bloating the ES6 bundle, you can easily do that.

#### An editable Service Worker
Thanks to the Workbox InjectManifest plugin, you can write your own code in 
the Service Worker. The precache manifest will then be injected at build 
time based on the chunks generated by your app.

#### Configurable Webpack and Gulp
CLIs help you doing the hard parts of your tasks without writing a single 
line of code, but while this is good when starting a project, it might 
become a con as soon as you need to add a custom configuration to your 
build. With this boilerplate you get the hard part already configured, but 
you also have the freedom to configure Webpack and Gulp in any way you want 
to.

## Ok, but why?
PRPL Server is pure awesomeness, but - apart from 
[PWA Starter Kit](https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-starter-kit) - I wasn't 
able to find a single boilerplate that allowed to easily get started with 
it. I love the work done by the Polymer team, but I hate being binded to a 
CLI. The aim of this boilerplate is to give a starting point to those who 
like me want to be free to do whatever they want.
